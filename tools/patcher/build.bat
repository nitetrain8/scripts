:: --onefile: makes the distributable a single EXE. The EXE unzips 
::            itself to a temporary directory when it runs, then
::            deletes it on exit. 
:: --distpath: By default, the binary ends up in ./dist and the
::             intermediate files end up in ./build. I changed
::             this to keep terminology similar between LabVIEW
::             and this script for convenience. 
:: --workpath: See above. 
:: --noconfirm: No warning when overwriting output files
