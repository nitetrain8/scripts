# Note - whenever the structure of a config file
# is naturally represented using a hierarchy of 
# nested structures (System Variables, Cal Factors...),
# the name of each variable below should be a dotted
# name path (Agitation.Minimum (RPM), etc). 

# Force a setting to specific value.
# Use strings "New" or "User" to 
# force the merge parser to always
# use the New reference or User's 
# value, respectively. Functionally
# Equivalent to the "New" and "User"
# fields below.
