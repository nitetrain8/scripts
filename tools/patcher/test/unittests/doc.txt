Unit testing of the merge.exe executable uses pytest and a custom test discovery system. 
Some details included in the top-level readme for this package. 

Most of the system code is located in the "util.py" file. the "conftest.py" file
is a special file that pytest uses to load hooks and custom behavior. The hooks
are loaded from the conftest.py file, which uses the utilities from the util.py file
to discover tests according to the name format. 

As a special note, this suite can be run in python mode or executable mode. In executable mode,
the merge.exe itself is rebuilt and used to run the tests. In python mode, the scripts are loaded
directly from python. 

The individual file types are tested via different test_*.py scripts. Each loads test cases of 
the given type, runs them, collects the resulting output and expected outputs, and 
performs comparison (usually using util.py's functions) to produce human-digestible
output in the event of failures.
