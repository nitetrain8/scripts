# The parser will attempt to sanity check everything

# Note - whenever the structure of a config file
# is naturally represented using a hierarchy of 
# nested structures (System Variables, Cal Factors...),
# the name of each variable below should be a dotted
# name path (Agitation.Minimum (RPM), etc). 

# Force a setting to specific value.
# Use strings "New" or "User" to 
# force the merge parser to always
# use the New reference or User's 
# value, respectively. Functionally
# Equivalent to the "New" and "User"
# fields below. 

[Force Raw Value]

# Always use the new Default

# Always use User Value

[Force User Value]

# Todo - add options for reference files

# General options
# Output path is relative to caller's path, not EXE's
